# SciCompGroup8
Scientific Computing course assignments. Group consist of: Liesbet Ooghe, Frederieke Loth, Kushnava Singha

# Contents
This code is written for assignment 3 of Scientific Computing, a UvA Course.

'\src' contains files with functions to run the code
- direct.py: 
- eigenvalue_problem.py: This code holds functions to solve and visualize the eigenvalue problem.
- leapfrog.py: 
- phase.py:

'\results' contains output files with animations and images.


# Requirements
The code was run on Python 3.12 
Libraries IPython.display, numpy, time, scipy, matplotlib

# Usage
By running the run.ipynb you can run the neccesary code for the assignment. Please note that some cells may run for longer than 1 minute.

# Results
After running the simulations, the results are given in the run.ipynb file and/or the \results folder. 

# Conclusion
This project aims to investigate the use of a variety of methods to solve different types of partial differential equations (PDEs) for spatial and time-dependent solutions.
